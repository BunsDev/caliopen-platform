    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      In this policy, Caliopen refers to the web service of the Caliopen
      Project. This Privacy Policy explains (1) what information is collected
      when you access and use Caliopen (2) the use Caliopen makes of this
      information; and (3) the security applied to protect this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Caliopen, you consent to the terms outlined in this privacy
      policy.
    </p>
    <h2>Legal Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Caliopen is currently being built by Gandi. Gandi is located in France and
      all data storage are handled by Gandi under the french laws and
      regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any information provided to Caliopen is considered personal data as
      defined and protected by the french DPA (CNIL).
    </p>
    <p>
      Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications
      about Caliopen (to create your account, recover your password...). You are
      free, at any given time, to delete your account and all the information it
      holds through the account settings panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service's user data collection is limited to the following:<br />
      Visiting or using our website: We employ a local installation of Matomo,
      an open source analytics tool. Analytics are anonymized whenever possible
      and stored locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Account creation:</em> You have to provide an external email address
      for notification or password recovery purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Account activity:</em> Depending on the protocols used when you
      exchange with your contacts, Caliopen may have to process some metadata:
      sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages
      originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times. We
      do NOT have access to encrypted message content but unencrypted messages
      sent from external providers to Caliopen are scanned for spam and viruses
      for the protection of our users. We also have access to the following
      records of account activity: devices signatures and parameters, number of
      messages sent, amount of storage space used, total number of messages,
      last login time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Communicating with Caliopen:</em> Your communications, such as support
      requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>IP Logging:</em> IP logs are kept for one year for statistics and to
      combat abuse and fraud, and your IP address may be retained if you are
      engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (spamming, DDoS
      attacks against Caliopen infrastructure, brute force attacks, etc).
    </p>
    <p>
      We do NOT do any analysis on the limited data we do possess with two
      exceptions:<br />
      Emails sent unencrypted to Caliopen accounts are scanned automatically for
      spam so we can block IPs which are sending a lot of spam to Caliopen users
      and tag spam messages with a very low importance level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emails sent unencrypted to Caliopen accounts are also scanned
      automatically for "smart" tagging.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All servers used in connection with Caliopen are wholly owned and operated
      by Gandi. Only Gandi's employees have physical or other access to the
      servers. User credentials needed for remote mailbox or private
      communication source like Twitter DM, are stored in encrypted format on
      our vault servers.
    </p>
    <h2>Right to Access, Rectification, Erasure and Portability</h2>
    <p>
      Through your interface, you can directly access, edit, or delete personal
      data processed by Caliopen.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      When a Caliopen account is closed, data is immediately deleted from
      production servers. Deleted messages are also permanently deleted from
      production servers.
    </p>
    <h2>Modifications to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Caliopen reserves the right to periodically review and change this policy
      from time to time and will notify users when it does. Continued use of
      Caliopen will be deemed as acceptance of such changes.
    </p>
    <h2>Applicable Law</h2>
    <p>This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by french laws.</p>
